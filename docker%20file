# Start from a Python image suitable for machine learning
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the dependency file and install Python packages
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the trained model and the application script
COPY random_forest_har_model.joblib .
COPY app.py .

# Expose the port where the application will run (e.g., 7860 for Gradio/Streamlit or 8080 for FastAPI/Flask)
EXPOSE 7860

# Command to run the application when the container starts
# We use Python and a lightweight web server (e.g., Gradio/Streamlit/Flask) for the demo.
# If you decide to use Gradio/Streamlit, the app.py should contain the interface logic.
# If you use Flask/FastAPI, adjust this command accordingly.

# Assuming you will switch to Gradio or Streamlit for the easiest deployment:
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

# OR, if you use a tool like Streamlit:
# CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port", "7860", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0"]
